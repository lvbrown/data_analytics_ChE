    "# Homework 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first homework of the course! Every homework in this course will consist of two parts: the first part is auto-graded and the second part is peer-graded. Throughout this semester, you will consistently work with `Jupyter Notebooks`, which is a great tool to make use of and run `Python` interactively on your laptop/desktop. To launch `Jupyter Notebooks` on your device, you should first install **Anaconda** and you can find installation instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with `Jupyter Notebooks` you may wish to check out some tutorials. These notebooks are widely used in data science, so you can find a lot of useful information by \"googling\" (this is true of many topics in this course). For example, this [beginners tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) is a good starting point. It is **highly recommended** that you learn to install and run `Jupyter Notebooks` on your own computer. However, for many Python beginners, especially those more familiar with MATLAB, the [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) IDE might seem more familiar. You can always write/test code in Spyder (or any other IDE or text editor), then paste it into Jupyter cells. Similarly, you can download Jupyter notebooks as Python scripts (`File` $\\rightarrow$ `Download as` $\\rightarrow$ `Python (.py)`) and edit/run them in Spyder. If this feels like a lot of info at once, don't worry! The main point of these first exercises is just to get you used to the infrastructure we use in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a unified and integrated workflow for submitting deliverables, we will utilize **Vocareum**, which is a cloud-based educational platform where you are right now. You **must submit all deliverables through Vocareum** and we will not accept deliverables via any channels besides Vocareum. Some students may not have even used `Jupyter Notebooks` before, so we know there is a learning curve. We hope that this first homework will serve as tutorial for how to write scripts and submit your deliverables."

    "# Part 1: Auto-graded\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will see code blocks with different colors. Blocks colored in dark gray are where your script will be auto-graded. If those blocks do not give you an error, you may move on to the next question. For code blocks with light gray, you only need to write your codes after `# Start your code here`. Other light gray blocks are not editable, and they are just for providing necessary variables. You may also want to add additional cells when you are working on this notebook. However, make sure that you remove them all and check that the whole script runs (`Kernel` $\\rightarrow$ `Restart & Run All`) without any errors before you submit it. Otherwise, you will recevie **0 credit** for this part. You should already know the your score for auto-graded part of the assignment when you submit the assignment due to the auto-grader, so if you have questions or see issues please let an instructor know at least 24 hours before the assignment is due.\n",

    "Since this is the first part of your first assignment, we will **grade it out of 50 points** (rather than 100). This means you can choose to only work some of the problems, or only some parts of all problems. The total grade cannot exceed 100%, but it is recommended that students at least attempt all problems to get practice for future assignments."

    "The rank of a M × N matrix is min(M, N) if all columns (or rows) are linearly independent. Since all columns of a Vandermonde matrix are linearly independent, the rank of the current matrix is 7, which is min(7, 40). In this case, the rank is dependent on the number of columns so the rank does not change as the resolution (i.e. the number of rows) increases."
